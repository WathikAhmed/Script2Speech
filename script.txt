Alright, listen up, tech heads! Microsoft just swung the layoff axe AGAIN.

But here's the tea: This time, it ain't about *your* performance. Sources say it's mainly middle management getting the boot.

Why? Apparently, Microsoft's streamlining, cutting layers, and betting big on AI. Think fewer bosses, more automation.

This matters becauseâ€¦ well, more automation means fewer jobs down the line. And if you're in middle management? Start polishing that resume.

Here's the spicy take: Is Microsoft actually preparing to be acquired? The streamlined structure could make them a much tastier bite for a company like NVIDIA.

What do YOU think? Is this the end of middle management? Let me know in the comments! And hit that follow button for more tech truth bombs!
